# Description

CRUD web application for movie management. Allows you to add, edit, delete and search for movies.

I wrote this application mainly for learning purposes for myself. Now I am sharing this project
with same goal in mind - however for others. I hope this project will be interesting for those
who are interested in how to create these types of applications.

The code is documented to a certain extent.

It is assumed that the reader has at least some basic familiarity with the technologies used in this project in order to fully benefit from reading it.

Front end frameworks (e.g. Angular) are not being used, since this way, readers will be able to better see how to implement such project themselves, without relying on other frameworks.

# Technology used

On the front end we use: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery.

For back end, we use: Node.js and Mongo DB.

# How to run the project

1. Clone the project.
2. Inside the project run

  ` npm install` 

3. Finally run

  ` node index.js` 

4. Now you should be able to access the application at: localhost:3000, from your browser.

NOTE: You need to have Mongo DB service running, and a database named "Movies" created.
