**Description**

CRUD web application for movie management. Allows you to add, edit, delete and search for movies.

This application was mainly created for learning purposes, and is also shared with that
goal in mind. I hope people who have recently started in Web development, and also in Node.js
in particular, will find analyzing source code of this project useful.

The code is documented to a certain extent, which I hope will further aid those who are interested to see how the project was implemented.
