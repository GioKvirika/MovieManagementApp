**Description**

CRUD web application for movie management. Allows you to add, edit, delete and search for movies.

This application was mainly created for learning purposes, and is also shared with that
goal in mind. I hope people who have recently started in Web development, and also in Node.js
in particular, will find analyzing source code of this project useful.

DISCLAIMER: When creating this project I was myself learning Node.js - and was a bit new to web development in general,
but despite this I hope you will still find this project useful. PS. The project at least works as far as I have tested.

**Technology used**

On the front end we use: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery.

For back end, we use: Node.js and Mongo DB.

**How to run the project**

1. Clone the project.
2. Inside the project run

  ` npm install` 

3. Finally run

  ` node index.js` 

NOTE: You need to have Mongo DB instance running, and a database named "Movies" created.
